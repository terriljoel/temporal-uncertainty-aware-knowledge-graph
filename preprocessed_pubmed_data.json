    "original_text": "Randomized Controlled Feasibility Trial of Late 8-Hour Time-Restricted Eating for Adolescents With Type 2 Diabetes.. No trial to date has tested the effects of late time-restricted eating (lTRE) on glycemic control or body composition in adolescents with type 2 diabetes (T2D). The objective of the current study was to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of lTRE compared to a prolonged eating window in adolescents with T2D. A 12-week, randomized, controlled, feasibility study of lTRE compared to control in adolescents with obesity and new onset T2D was conducted. Eligible participants were 13-21 years old; with a diagnosis of T2D, on metformin monotherapy, recruited from Children's Hospital Los Angeles, between January 2021 and December of 2022. From 36 eligible participants, 27 were enrolled (75% recruitment rate; age: 16.5 \u00b1 1.7 years, HbA1c: 6.6 \u00b1 0.9%, 22/27 [81%] Hispanic, 17/27 [63%] female, 23/27 [85%] public insurance; all p-values >.05), and 23 of 27 completed the protocol. Participants wore a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) daily and were randomized to one of two meal-timing schedules for 12-weeks: (1) lTRE (eating all food between 12:00 PM and 20:00 PM without calorie counting or recommended daily caloric intake) or (2) Control (eating over a period of 12 or more hours per day). Study recruitment, retention and adherence to intervention arms were captured to operationalize feasibility. Glucose control (HbA1c), weight loss (%BMI<sub>p95</sub>), total body fat mass on DEXA, sleep, and dietary intake were explored as secondary outcomes. Analyses were based on the intention to treat (ITT) population. Between-group differences in clinical outcomes were assessed using mixed-effects longitudinal regression models. Overall adherence to the 8-hr lTRE was 6.2 \u00b1 1.1 d/wk and Control was 5.9 \u00b1 0.9 d/wk. Participants assigned to lTRE indicated that limiting their eating window did not negatively affect their daily functioning and no adverse events were reported. In this pilot study, lTRE led to a reduction in %BMI<sub>p95</sub> (-3.4%-95%CI: -6.1, -0.7, p = 0.02), HbA1c (-0.4%, 95%CI: -0.9, -0.01, p = .06), and ALT (-31.1 U/L, 95%CI: -60, -2, p = .05) within the group. There was no significant difference observed between lTRE and control across these measures (all p > .05). The lTRE group had a -271.4 (95% CI, -565.2, 5.2) kcal/day energy reduction compared to a +293.2 (95% CI: 30.4, 552.7) kcal/day increase in Control (p = .01). There were no significant changes observed in sleep or eating behaviors over the study period between groups. Recruitment and retention rates suggest a trial of lTRE in adolescents with T2D was feasible. lTRE was seen as acceptable by participants and adherence was high. A revised intervention, building on the successful elements of this pilot alongside adapting implementations strategies to augment adherence and engagement, should therefore be considered.",

Multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter 1 (MATE1), encoded by the SLC47A1 gene and single nucleotide polymorphisms of organic cation transport 1, may impact metformin's responsiveness and side effects. Inward-rectifier potassium channel 6.2 (Kir 6.2) subunits encoded by KCNJ11 may affect the response to sulfonylurea. This study aimed to evaluate the association between SLC22A1 rs72552763 and rs628031, SLC47A1 rs2289669 and KCNJ11 rs5219 genetic variations with sulfonylurea and metformin combination therapy efficacy and safety in Egyptian type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. This study was conducted on 100 cases taking at least one year of sulfonylurea and metformin combination therapy. Patients were genotyped <i>via</i> the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism technique. Then, according to their glycated hemoglobin level, cases were subdivided into non-responders or responders. Depending on metformin-induced gastrointestinal tract side effects incidence, patients are classified as tolerant or intolerant. KCNJ11 rs5219 heterozygous and homozygous mutant genotypes, SLC47A1 rs2289669 heterozygous and homozygous mutant genotypes (AA and AG), and mutant alleles of both polymorphisms were significantly related with increased response to combined therapy. Individuals with the SLC22A1 (rs72552763) GAT/del genotype and the SLC22A1 (rs628031) AG and AA genotypes were at a higher risk for metformin-induced gastrointestinal tract adverse effects. The results implied a role for SLC47A1 rs2289669 and KCNJ11 rs5219 in the responsiveness to combined therapy. SLC22A1 (rs628031) and (rs72552763) polymorphisms may be associated with increased metformin adverse effects in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.",

Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most prevalent metabolic diseases during female reproductive life, often associated with insulin resistance and hyperprolactinemia. The efficacy of metformin and cabergoline for managing PCOS remains debated in the literature. This three-arm interventional study in Iraq assessed the effects of these drugs on body mass index (BMI), hormonal balance, and uterine artery blood flow in 75 women with PCOS and hyperprolactinemia. Participants were randomized into three groups: metformin (500 mg twice daily), cabergoline (0.5 mg weekly), and a combination of both, with 25 patients in each group. Baseline and 90-day follow-up characteristics included BMI, serum hormonal levels, and ultrasound features. Metformin resulted in significant weight reduction (p=0.038); however, the addition of cabergoline caused a more significant reduction in body mass index (p=0.001). The combined treatment significantly lowered testosterone levels (p=0.008). In addition, this combination significantly reduced the level of LH (p=0.043) and increased the level of FSH (p=0.047). The results suggest that metformin and cabergoline when used together, act synergistically and safely to reduce BMI, testosterone, and LH levels while increasing FSH levels. Furthermore, this combination improved endometrial blood flow and ovulation in women with PCOS.",

Glucocorticoids have therapeutic benefits in the management of several inflammatory and immunological disorders. Despite these medicinal effects, they have the drawback of causing metabolic disorders such as hyperglycemia, insulin resistance etc., which is known to be a key indicator of metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is a major predisposing factor to type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiomyopathy. This study was designed to compare and evaluate the effects of saxagliptin, metformin and intranasal insulin (when used singly or in combination) on dexamethasone induced insulin resistance. Fifty-six female rats were randomly assigned into eight groups. Group 1 represented the control; Group 2 was administered with dexamethasone (1mg/kg) (untreated); Group 3 received dexamethasone + intranasal insulin (2IU); Group 4 received dexamethasone + intranasal insulin + metformin (40mg/kg); Group 5; received dexamethasone + intranasal + saxagliptin (8mg/kg); Group 6 received dexamethasone + metformin (40mg/kg); Group 7 received dexamethasone + saxagliptin (8mg/kg); Group 8 received dexamethasone + saxagliptin(8mg/kg) + metformin(40mg/kg). Treatments were given for one week. At the end of the study, blood samples were collected for biochemical assays and pancreas excised for histological examination. Dexamethasone (1mg/kg) induced hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance and disrupted the structural integrity of the pancreas. Treatment with saxagliptin, metformin and their combination significantly decreased blood glucose level, decreased LDL Level and improved glucose tolerance. The selected hypoglycemic agents used in present study ameliorate the dexamethasone induced hyperglycemia and insulin resistance of which the combination of metformin with saxagliptin showed greater efficacy.",

As a popular antidiabetic drug, teneligliptin has been used for over 10 years, but its efficacy and safety have rarely been systematically evaluated. Therefore, a Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of teneligliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing teneligliptin with placebo or active comparators in T2DM patients for at least 12 weeks were included in the study. Data analysis was performed using R 4.2.3 and Stata 17.0 software. Each outcome was presented as a mean difference (MD) or an odds ratio (OR) along with 95% confidence interval (CI) and the surface under the cumulative ranking curve value (SUCRA). A total of 18 RCTs with 3,290 participants with T2DM were included in this study. Generally, compared to placebo, sitagliptin, vildagliptin, metformin, and bromocriptine, 20 mg of teneligliptin showed better efficacy in reducing HbA1c (MD [95% CI], -0.78 [-0.86 to -0.70], -0.08 [-0.36 to 0.19], -0.04 [-0.72 to 0.60], -0.12 [-0.65 to 0.42], and -0.50 [-0.74 to -0.26], respectively) and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (MD [95% CI], -18.02 [-20.64 to -15.13], 1.17 [-9.39 to 11.70], -8.06 [-30.95 to 14.35], -2.75 [-18.89 to 13.01], and -34.23 [-45.93 to -22.96], respectively), and 40 mg of teneligliptin also showed better efficacy in reducing HbA1c (MD [95% CI], -0.84 [-1.03 to -0.65], -0.15 [-0.49 to 0.19], -0.10 [-0.81 to 0.57], -0.18 [-0.76 to 0.39], and -0.56 [-0.88 to -0.26], respectively) and FPG (MD [95% CI], -20.40 [-26.07 to -14.57], -1.20 [-13.21 to 10.38], -10.43 [-34.16 to 12.65], -5.13 [-22.21 to 11.66], and -36.61 [-49.33 to -24.01], respectively). Compared to placebo, 20 mg of teneligliptin showed no significant difference in incidences of hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal adverse events (OR [95% CI], 1.30 [0.70 to 2.19] and 1.48 [0.78 to 2.98], respectively), and 40 mg of teneligliptin showed no significant difference in incidence of hypoglycemia (OR [95% CI], 2.63 [0.46 to 8.10]). Generally, antidiabetic effect and hypoglycemia risk of teneligliptin gradually increased as its dose increased from 5 mg to 40 mg. Compared to 20 mg of teneligliptin, 40 mg of teneligliptin showed superior efficacy and no-inferior safety, which was considered as the best option in reducing HbA1c, FPG, and 2h PPG and increasing proportion of the patients achieving HbA1c < 7% (SUCRA, 85.51%, 84.24%, 79.06%, and 85.81%, respectively) among all the included interventions. Compared to sitagliptin, vildagliptin, metformin, bromocriptine, and placebo, teneligliptin displayed favorable efficacy and acceptable safety in treating T2DM. Twenty milligrams or 40 mg per day was the optimal dosage regimen of teneligliptin. The results of this study will provide important evidence-based basis for rational use of teneligliptin and clinical decision-making of T2DM medication.",

Compared to 20 mg of teneligliptin, 40 mg of teneligliptin showed superior efficacy and no-inferior safety, which was considered as the best option in reducing HbA1c, FPG, and 2h PPG and increasing proportion of the patients achieving HbA1c 7 (SUCRA, 85.51 , 84.24 , 79.06 , and 85.81 , respectively) among all the included interventions. Compared to sitagliptin, vildagliptin, metformin, bromocriptine, and placebo, teneligliptin displayed favorable efficacy and acceptable safety in treating T2DM. Twenty milligrams or 40 mg per day was the optimal dosage regimen of teneligliptin. The results of this study will provide important evidence-based basis for rational use of teneligliptin and clinical decision-making of T2DM medication.",

To incorporate new clusters in the MARCH (Metformin and AcaRbose in Chinese patients as the initial Hypoglycemic treatment) cohort of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients and compare the anti-glycemic effects of metformin and acarbose across different clusters. K-means cluster analysis was performed based on six clinical indicators. The diabetic clusters in the MARCH cohort were retrospectively associated with the response to metformin and acarbose. A total of 590 newly diagnosed T2D patients were classified by data-driven clusters into the MARD (mild obesity-related diabetes) (34.1\u00a0%), MOD (mild obesity-related diabetes) (34.1\u00a0%), SIDD (severe insulin-deficient diabetes) (20.3\u00a0%) and SIRD (severe insulin-resistant diabetes) (11.5\u00a0%) subgroups at baseline. At 24 and 48 weeks, 346 participants had finished the follow-up. After the adjustment of age, gender, weight, baseline HbA1c, baseline fasting glucose and 2-h postprandial blood glucose (2hPG), metformin mainly decreased the fasting glucose (0.07\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.89 vs -0.26\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.83, P\u00a0=\u00a00.043) in the MARD subgroup presented with OGTT (oral glucose tolerance test) results compared with acarbose group at 24 weeks. Acarbose led to a greater decrease in 2hPG in the MOD subgroup compared with metformin group (0.08\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.86 vs -0.24\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.92, P\u00a0=\u00a00.037) at 24 weeks. There was a also significant interaction between cluster and treatment efficacy in HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) reduction in metformin and acarbose groups at 24 and 48 weeks (p<sub>interaction</sub><0.001). Metformin and acarbose affected different metabolic variables depending on the diabetes subtype.",

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), defined as the accumulation of >5% fat in the liver, is the most frequently co-exist disease with diabetics up to 70%. Current study was conducted to compare efficacy of combination therapy of empagliflozin (EMPA) or pioglitazone (PGZ) with metformin (MET) in patients with T2DM and NAFLD. In this open label, prospective clinical trial, sixty patients were randomly assigned to receive EMPA 10\u00a0mg/day or PGZ 30\u00a0mg/day in combination Metformin (at least 1500\u00a0mg) for six months. NAFLD grade and liver stiffness were defined and measured at the beginning and after 6 months. As the secondary outcomes, anthropometric characteristics, lipid profile, plasma glucose test, and liver enzymes test were measured at the baseline and endpoint. The results showed that both combination therapy with EMPA+ MET or PGZ+MET significantly reversed fibrosis stage of NAFLD (P<0.05). Significant reduction in lipid profile test, and liver enzymes test were seen in both groups (P<0.05). However, the greater reduction in waist circumference was observed in EMPA groups compared to PGZ (-4.4\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.39\u00a0vs -2.05\u00b11.28, p<0.001), meanwhile weight and BMI decreased significantly only in the patients receiving EMPA (-5.78\u00a0\u00b1\u00a03.6\u00a0kg vs 0.93\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.33\u00a0kg and -2.01\u00b1 3.19\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup> vs 0.33\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.12\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively, P<0.001). combination of EMPA or PGZ with metformin equally improved liver fibrosis stage and stiffness in T2DM patients with NAFLD. The improvements of laboratory tests were observed in the both groups, while, regarding weight reduction, only the regimen containing EMPA was effective.",

The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of pioglitazone and linagliptin on glycemic control, lipid profile and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) parameters in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin. The present randomized clinical trial was conducted on 60 patients with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin in the age range of 30-60 years. The participants with informed consent were randomly assigned to receive pioglitazone or linagliptin. The first intervention group (n=30) received 30\u202fmg of pioglitazone daily and the second intervention group (n=30) received 5\u202fmg of linagliptin daily for 12\u00a0weeks. Fasting blood samples were taken from patients at the baseline and after 12\u00a0weeks to measure related variables. The current study was approved in Kashan University of Medical Sciences (with the code of ethics of IR.KAUMS.MEDNT.REC.1398.016), and the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials (with the registration number of IRCT20170513033941N66). The linagliptin administration significantly reduced serum levels of fasting blood sugar (p=0.03), blood sugar 2\u202fh after a meal (p=0.02), glycosylated hemoglobin (p=0.02) and hs-CRP (p=0.005) after 12\u00a0weeks compared with pioglitazone. In contrast, the pioglitazone administration significantly decreased triglyceride levels (p=0.01) and increased HDL-cholesterol (p=0.002) compared to linagliptin. In addition, the administration of both linagliptin and pioglitazone drugs had no significant effect on LDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, creatinine and blood urea. The present study demonstrated the superiority of linagliptin over pioglitazone for glycemic control, although pioglitazone compared to linagliptin showed greater efficacy in reducing triglycerides and raising HDL-cholesterol.",

The treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) necessitates a multifaceted approach that combines behavioral and pharmacological interventions to mitigate complications and sustain a high quality of life. Treatment encompasses the management of glucose levels, weight, cardiovascular risk factors, comorbidities, and associated complications through medication and lifestyle adjustments. Metformin, a standard in diabetes management, continues to serve as the primary, first-line oral treatment across all age groups due to its efficacy, versatility in combination therapy, and cost-effectiveness. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) offer notable benefits for HbA1c and weight reduction, with significant cardiovascular benefits. Sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors (SGLT-2i) lower glucose levels independently of insulin while conferring notable benefits for cardiovascular, renal, and heart-failure outcomes. Combined therapies emphasizing early and sustained glycemic control are promising options for diabetes management. As insulin therapy remains pivotal, metformin and non-insulin agents such as GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2i offer compelling options. Notably, exciting novel treatments like the dual GLP-1/ glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) agonist show promise for substantially reducing glycated hemoglobin and body weight. This comprehensive review highlights the evolving landscape of pharmacotherapy in diabetes, the drugs currently available for treating diabetes, their effectiveness and efficacy, the impact on target organs, and side effects. This work also provides insights that can support the customization of treatment strategies.",

Metformin is recommended as a first-line drug in the guidelines of the treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus. However, high-quality evidence from clinical trials directly comparing the degree of hypoglycemic effect of combination therapy of metformin and a hypoglycemic agent with a different mechanism of action with that of monotherapy of a hypoglycemic drug is lacking. We aimed to examine whether combination therapy of hypoglycemic agents with metformin showed antagonism, addition, or synergism compared to monotherapy with hypoglycemic agents other than metformin regarding hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> levels. This retrospective cohort study used a medical information database in Japan. Non-insulin anti-hyperglycemic agents with different mechanisms of action were classified into eight drug classes. A monotherapy cohort and a combination therapy added to the metformin cohort were defined. The change in hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> levels was evaluated to compare the treatment effect between the cohorts. A total of 13,359 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the monotherapy cohort and 1,064 in the metformin combination therapy cohort were identified. A comparison of the change from baseline HbA1c level by drug class between the two cohorts showed a similar trend. Among those treated with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor, no clinically significant difference was observed between the two cohorts (0.00% and -0.07% for unadjusted, 0.15% and -0.03% for propensity score matching-adjusted, and 0.09% and -0.01% for inverse probability treatment weighting-adjusted analysis). According to the results of this study, the effect of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor or sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitor added to metformin seems to be additive with respect to the reduction in hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub>.",

To determine the clinical efficacy of Polyethylene Glycol Loxenatide in the treatment of obese or overweight Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients. A randomised-controlled trial. Place and Duration of the Study: Department of Endocrinology, Baoding\u00a0No. 1\u00a0Central\u00a0Hospital, Hebei, China, from January 2020 to January 2022. One hundred overweight and obese patients who were diagnosed with T2DM were prospectively included. They were randomly divided into two groups, with 50 cases in each group. The control group was given oral metformin + subcutaneous insulin injection. The combined treatment group was also given Polyethylene Glycol Loxenatide\u00a0in addition to the control treatment. The duration of treatment was 6 months for both groups. The clinical efficacy of the two group treatments was compared. The height, body mass, weight index (body mass index (BMI)), total cholesterol (TC), 2-h postprandial blood glucose (2hPBG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting insulin (FINS), lipids (triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) levels, fasting blood glucose (FPG), and glycosylated haemoglobin (HbAlc) were evaluated before and 6 months after the treatment. In addition, any adverse reactions in the two groups were observed. The overall effective rate of clinical therapy was 92% (46/50) in the combined treatment group, which was higher than that of the control group (76%, 38/50, p = 0.029). The weight and BMI levels of the combined treatment group became considerably lower than those of the control group (weight p = 0.004; BMI p <0.001), and the levels of FPG, 2hPBG, FINS, HbAlc and HOMA-IR (all p = <0.001), and the TG and TC values decreased in both groups (TG p = 0.001; TC p = 0.016). PEG Loxenatide considerably affects obese and overweight T2DM patients. With no noticeable adverse reactions, this drug is highly recommended for application and clinical promotion.

We aimed to evaluated the effect of premixed insulin (Ins), premixed insulin combined with metformin (Ins+Met) or mulberry twig alkaloids(Ins+SZ-A) on blood glucose fluctuations in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) using continuous glucose monitors (CGM). Thirty patients with T2DM and poor blood glucose control using drugs were evaluated for eligibility during the screening period. Subsequently, their original hypoglycemic drugs were discontinued during the lead-in period, and after receiving Ins intensive treatment for 2 weeks, they were randomly assigned to receive either Ins, Ins+Met, or Ins+SZ-A treatment for the following 12 weeks. The main efficacy endpoint comprised changes in their CGM indicators changes (mean blood glucose level [MBG], standard deviation of blood glucose [SDBG], mean amplitude of glycemic excursions [MAGE], postprandial glucose excursions [PPGE], the largest amplitude of glycemic excursions [LAGE], mean of daily difference [MODD], time in range between 3.9-10.0 mmol/L [TIR] and area under the curve for each meal [AUCpp]) during the screening, lead-in, and after 12-week treatment period. Changes in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose (FBG), 1-h postprandial blood glucose (1h-PBG), 2-h postprandial blood glucose (2h-PBG), fasting blood lipids and postprandial blood lipids were also measured at baseline and after 12 weeks of treatment. The CGM indicators of the three groups during the lead-in period all showed significant improvements compared to the screening period (P<0.05). Compared with those in the lead-in period, all of the CGM indicators improved in the the Ins+Met and Ins+SZ-A groups after 12 weeks of treatment (P<0.05), except for MODD. After 12-week treatment, compared with the Ins group, Ins+Met and Ins+SZ-A groups showed improved MBG, SDBG, TIR, breakfast AUCpp,lunch AUCpp, HbA1c, FBG, 1h-PBG, fasting blood lipid and postprandial blood lipid indicators (P<0.05). Further, the LAGE, PPGE, MAGE, dinner AUCpp and 2h-PBG levels of the Ins+SZ-A group were significantly lower than those of the Ins+Met and Ins groups (P<0.05). Our findings highlight the efficacy of combination therapy (Ins+SZ-A or Ins+Met) in improving blood glucose fluctuations, as well as blood glucose and lipid levels. Ins+SZ-A reduces postprandial blood glucose fluctuations more than Ins+Met and Ins groups. ISRCTN20835488.",

This meta-analysis aimed to compare the effectiveness of metformin versus lifestyle interventions in preventing diabetes in individuals with prediabetes. We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and conducted a comprehensive search of databases (PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE) up to September 1, 2023. Five eligible studies were included. The results showed that there was no significant difference in the risk of developing diabetes between the metformin and lifestyle intervention groups (RR: 1.14, 95% CI: 0.77-1.68). Similarly, when comparing metformin with lifestyle intervention, the risk of diabetes was slightly higher in the metformin group, but this difference was not statistically significant (RR: 1.31, 95% CI: 0.93-1.86). When comparing metformin with lifestyle intervention to lifestyle intervention alone, no significant difference was observed in the incidence of diabetes (RR: 0.88, 95% CI: 0.74-1.04). In conclusion, our analysis found that the incidence of type 2 diabetes was slightly higher in patients receiving metformin alone compared to lifestyle intervention, but this difference did not reach statistical significance. Further trials are necessary to better evaluate these interventions for preventing type 2 diabetes in high-risk individuals.",

Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the demographic, clinical characteristics, and treatment patterns of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Indian settings in the above context. \u00a0This observational study conducted at 600 healthcare centers in India retrospectively analyzed data of adult patients with T2DM who had been treated with either vildagliptin with insulin or a combination of vildagliptin and metformin with insulin. Data were collected from medical records and analyzed by appropriate statistical tests. \u00a0A total of 12,603 patients with T2DM were included with a mean age of 53.4 years of which 63.8% were males. The majority of patients (n=6511; 51.7%) received a combination of vildagliptin and metformin on top of insulin. A significantly high proportion of patients in the age group of 18-40 years received this treatment compared to patients who were initiated on insulin treatment after vildagliptin and metformin combination (11.6% vs. 9.7%; P<0.001). Of all the patients, 70.0% were able to achieve target glycemic control with either VIS-INS or VIL-MET-INS. After treatment with VIL-INS or VIL-MET-INS, the mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels significantly decreased with a mean change of 1.46%. Out of all patients, 13.5% experienced weight changes during treatment, with 67.4% of them showing weight loss. A total of 68 patients reported hypoglycemic events and among them, 49 patients had mild hypoglycemic events. Physician global evaluation of efficacy and tolerability showed a majority of patients rated their experience as good to excellent (86.3% and 86.0%, respectively). \u00a0Both treatment regimens were\u00a0effective in terms of reduced HbA1c to achieve glycemic control. Furthermore, it is well tolerated without an increase in the risk of hypoglycemia or weight gain. Hence, this therapy has favorable outcomes for T2DM management in Indian clinical settings.",

Metformin (Met) is the first-line therapy in type 2 diabetes mellitus but, in last few years, it has also been evaluated as anti-cancer agent. Several pathways, such as AMPK or PI3K/Akt/mTOR, are likely to be involved in the anti-cancer Met activity. In addition, hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) and H<sub>2</sub>S donors have been described as anti-cancer agents affecting cell-cycle and inducing apoptosis. Among H<sub>2</sub>S donors, isothiocyanates are endowed with a further anti-cancer mechanism: the inhibition of the histone deacetylase enzymes. On this basis, a hybrid molecule (Met-ITC) obtained through the addition of an isothiocyanate moiety to the Met molecule was designed and its ability to release Met has been demonstrated. Met-ITC exhibited more efficacy and potency than Met in inhibiting cancer cells (AsPC-1, MIA PaCa-2, MCF-7) viability and it was less effective on non-tumorigenic cells (MCF 10-A). The ability of Met-ITC to release H<sub>2</sub>S has been recorded both in cell-free and in cancer cells assays. Finally, its ability to affect the cell cycle and to induce both early and late apoptosis has been demonstrated on the most sensitive cell line (MCF-7). These results confirmed that Met-ITC is a new hybrid molecule endowed with potential anti-cancer properties derived both from Met and H<sub>2</sub>S.",

Cognitive impairment is anotable complication of type 2 diabetes (T2DM), accompanied by reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the brain and blood. Anti-diabetic drugs reduce hyperglycemia, yet their effect on cognitive improvement is unknown. We aimed to investigate the effect of anti-diabetic drugs regulating BDNF in T2DM through computational and case-control study design. We obtained T2DMproteins viatext-mining to construct a T2DMprotein network. From the T2DMnetwork, the metformin and glimepiride interactomes and their crucial shortest-path-stimulating BDNF were identified. Using qRTPCR, the genes encoding the shortest-path proteins were assessed in four groups (untreated-T2DM, metformin-treated, glimepiride-treated, and healthy controls). Finally, ELISA was used to assess serum BDNF levels to validate drug efficacy. As a result of this investigation, aT2DMnetwork was constructed with 3683 text-mined proteins. Then, the T2DMnetwork was explored to generate a metformin and glimepiride interactome that establishes the critical shortest-path for BDNF stimulation. Metformin stimulates BDNF via APP binding to the PRKAB1 receptor. Whereas, glimepiride increases BDNF by binding to KCNJ11 via AP2M1 and ESR1 proteins. Both drug shortest-path encoding genes differed significantly between the groups. Unlike metformin, BDNF gene and protein expression rise significantly with glimepiride. Overall, glimepiride can effectively increase BDNF, which could benefit T2DM patients with cognitive deterioration.",

This opinion article highlights the potential alterations caused by insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia on the cardiovascular system and their negative impact on heart failure (HF), and describes the potential benefits of an early screening with consequent prompt treatment. HF is the final event of several different cardiovascular diseases. Its incidence has been increasing over the last decades because of increased survival from ischemic heart disease thanks to improvements in its treatment (including myocardial revascularization interventions) and the increase in life span. In particular, incidence of HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is significantly increasing, and patients with HFpEF often are also affected by diabetes mellitus and insulin resistance (IR), with a prevalence > 45%. Concentric left ventricular (LV) remodeling and diastolic dysfunction are the main structural abnormalities that characterize HFpEF. It is well documented in the literature that IR with chronic hyperinsulinemia, besides causing type 2 diabetes mellitus, can cause numerous cardiovascular alterations, including endothelial dysfunction and increased wall thicknesses of the left ventricle with concentric remodeling and diastolic dysfunction. Therefore, it is conceivable that IR might play a major role in the pathophysiology and the progressive worsening of HF. To date, several substances have been shown to reduce IR/hyperinsulinemia and have beneficial clinical effects in patients with HF, including SGLT2 inhibitors, metformin, and berberine. For this reason, an early screening of IR could be advisable in subjects at risk and in patients with heart failure, to promptly intervene with appropriate therapy. Future studies aimed at comparing the efficacy of the substances used both alone and in association are needed.",

The circular interactions between type 2 diabetes (TMD2) and major depressive disorder (MDD) are well documented but the understanding of their mechanisms has only recently gained more clarity. Latest research indicates, that the association between TMD2 and MDD is largely mediated by insulin resistance (IR). A metabolic subtype of MDD can be distinguished from other MDD subpopulations, that is characterized by predominantly atypical clinical presentation, IR and different responsiveness to antidepressant interventions. IR is a predictor of nonresponse to some antidepressants. The IR seems to be a state-marker of clinical or subclinical depression and the relationship between IR and MDD varies between sexes and ethnicities. Insulin has a direct impact on the monoaminergic systems known to underlie MDD symptoms: serotoninergic and dopaminergic, which are dysregulated in IR subjects. Several trials assessed the efficacy of insulin-sensitizing drugs in MDD with mixed results for metformin and more consistent evidence for pioglitazone and lifestyle intervention/physical activity. Recently published data suggest a significant role of IR in the clinical presentation, pathophysiology and treatment response in MDD. Further research of IR in MDD and integration of existing data into clinical practice are needed.",

The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fixed-dose combination (FDC) of dapagliflozin (10\u00a0mg) and linagliptin (5\u00a0mg) in comparison to linagliptin 5\u00a0mg (Trajenta) in patients with insufficiently controlled type\u00a02 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) on metformin monotherapy. The double-blind, randomized, multicentric, parallel-group phase\u00a0III trial screened 287 adult patients with T2DM (age 18-65\u00a0years) from 16 sites across India. The recruited subjects were undergoing metformin monotherapy\u2009\u2265\u20091000\u00a0mg/day for at least 28\u00a0days. Patients with HbA1c of 7.5-10.5% (58-91\u00a0mmol/l) (n\u2009=\u2009232) after 2\u00a0weeks of run-in period with linagliptin monotherapy and placebo dapagliflozin/linagliptin on metformin monotherapy were randomized (1:1) in parallel to once daily dapagliflozin/linagliptin 10/5\u00a0mg or linagliptin 5\u00a0mg for 16\u00a0weeks. Patients were stratified on the basis of HbA1c (\u2264\u20099.0% and >\u20099.0%; \u2264\u200975\u00a0mmol/l and\u2009>\u200975\u00a0mmol/l)). A total of 225 subjects completed 16\u00a0weeks of treatment, 115 patients in the test group and 110 patients in the reference group. Dapagliflozin/linagliptin (p\u2009=\u20090.0003) exhibited a greater change in HbA1c from baseline than linagliptin (p\u2009<\u20090.0001) in 16\u00a0weeks (mean reduction, - 1.28% vs - 0.83%). Test group showed a significant decrease in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG) and body weight compared to the reference group. The FDC was well tolerated with adverse events being more frequent in the reference group. No serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in the study. Dapagliflozin/linagliptin combination is a novel dipeptidyl peptidase\u00a04 (DPP4)/sodium-glucose co-transporter\u00a02 (SGLT2) inhibitor FDC approved in India for patients with T2DM. Potential limitations of this study are a small dose of dapagliflozin (10\u00a0mg) in the FDC, a short study duration (30\u00a0weeks) and a high minimum threshold for HbA1c (\u2264\u20097.5%; \u2264\u200953\u00a0mmol/l). Results indicate the FDC to be a superior therapeutic option over linagliptin for patients with T2DM on metformin monotherapy. CTRI/2022/08/044563; 01/08/2022.",

Metformin has been used to treat cases of type 2 diabetes mellitus, and mounting studies have shown that metformin can act alone or in synergy with other anticancer agents to achieve anti-cancer efficacies on various types of tumors. However, the role of metformin in either inducing autophagy and cisplatin-resistance of human gastric cancer (GC) cells has never been examined. The study has established a cisplatin-resistant GC cell line and investigated the effects of metformin on inducing autophagy on it. The results demonstrated that treatment with metformin can concentration-dependently suppress the cell viability and cell confluence of cisplatin-resistant GC cells, while having no effects on human primary stomach epithelial cells (HPSEC). For the first time, we found that metformin can significantly increase the acidic vesicular organelles (AVO) level and decrease the acridine orange (AO) level spontaneously in the cisplatin-resistant GC cells. Thus, we further checked the other markers, Atg5, Atg12 and LC3-II, which showed that metformin indeed induced autophagy in the cisplatin-resistant GC cells. In addition, treatment of 3-Methyladenine (3-MA) can significantly rescue the metformin-induced autophagy. At the same time, metformin can induce the alterations of apoptosis-associated signal molecules, such as caspase-3 and caspase-7 activities. Overall, the pilot study provided evidence for metformin induced autophagy in addition to apoptosis, making it as an effective anticancer drug for the therapy of cisplatin-resistant GC. Killing the cisplatin-resistant GC cells with non-toxic metformin <i>via</i> both autophagy and apoptosis might extend its usefulness in our fighting with chemo-resistance of gastric cancer cells.",

    "original_text": "Efficacy and Safety of Switching from Sitagliptin to Ipragliflozin in Obese Japanese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Single-Arm Multicenter Interventional Study.. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors have limited efficacy in improving glycemic control for obese Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors are recommended for use in patients with type 2 diabetes with obesity. Nevertheless, there has been no previously published study on the effect of switching from dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors to sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors on the systemic and organic effects in obese Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of switching from sitagliptin to ipragliflozin for 24 weeks in obese Japanese patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes. Fifty-one obese patients with type 2 diabetes (body mass index >\u00a025\u00a0kg/m<sup>2</sup>) treated with sitagliptin (50 mg) and metformin but with inadequate glycemic control (glycosylated hemoglobin [HbA1c] >\u00a07.5% and <\u00a09.0%) were enrolled. After a 4-week observation period, sitagliptin was switched to ipragliflozin (50 mg) for 24 weeks. The primary outcome was the change in HbA1c from baseline to the end of treatment. The secondary outcomes were changes in clinical characteristics and other biochemical variables. Fifty-one patients with an average HbA1c of 8.37 \u00b1 0.48% and body mass index of 28.8 \u00b1 3.8 kg/m<sup>2</sup> were enrolled. Fifty patients\u00a0completed the study, one patient stopped ipragliflozin at 4 weeks because of the development of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome. No significant change in HbA1c from baseline to the end of treatment was observed (-\u00a00.02 \u00b1 0.75%). However, fasting plasma glucose was reduced (-\u00a016.2 \u00b1 28.4 mg/dL, p < 0.001), and biochemical variables associated with insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and hepatic and renal functions showed significant improvements. No severe adverse effects were observed, except in the one aforementioned case. Switching from sitagliptin to ipragliflozin did not alter HbA1c in obese patients with type 2 diabetes, while improving parameters related to organ homeostasis.

Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors have limited efficacy in improving glycemic control for obese Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors are recommended for use in patients with type 2 diabetes with obesity. Nevertheless, there has been no previously published study on the effect of switching from dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors to sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors on the systemic and organic effects in obese Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of switching from sitagliptin to ipragliflozin for 24 weeks in obese Japanese patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes. Fifty-one obese patients with type 2 diabetes (body mass index 25 kg m2) treated with sitagliptin (50 mg) and metformin but with inadequate glycemic control (glycosylated hemoglobin HbA1c 7.5 and 2 were enrolled. Fifty patients completed the study, one patient stopped ipragliflozin at 4 weeks because of the development of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic syndrome. No significant change in HbA1c from baseline to the end of treatment was observed (- 0.02 0.75 ). However, fasting plasma glucose was reduced (- 16.2 28.4 mg dL, p 0.001), and biochemical variables associated with insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and hepatic and renal functions showed significant improvements. No severe adverse effects were observed, except in the one aforementioned case. Switching from sitagliptin to ipragliflozin did not alter HbA1c in obese patients with type 2 diabetes, while improving parameters related to organ homeostasis.

    "original_text": "Efficacy and safety of polyethylene glycol loxenatide in type 2 diabetic patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.. Polyethylene glycol loxenatide (PEX168) is a novel glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist with a longer half-life developed by modifying the chemical structure of exenatide. This study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of PEX168 and determine the best dose. We searched PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science\u00a0databases from inception to April 25, 2023, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PEX168 therapy alone or in combination with metformin versus other therapies. We used the risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous outcomes and the mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes, both with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Six RCTs, including 1248 participants, were included. PEX168 added to metformin was significantly better than metformin alone regarding fasting blood glucose (MD\u2009=\u2009-1.20, 95% CI (-1.78, \u2009-\u20090.62), p\u2009<\u20090.0001), HbA1c (MD\u2009=\u2009-1.01, 95% CI (-1.48, \u2009-\u20090.53), p\u2009<\u20090.0001), and postprandial glycemia (MD\u2009=\u2009-1.94, 95% CI (-2.99, \u2009-\u20090.90), p\u2009=\u20090.0003). Similarly, for glycemic control, PEX168 monotherapy was superior to placebo (P\u2009<\u20090.05). No significant effects were noticed in terms of triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, or high-density lipoprotein (p\u2009>\u20090.05). Body weight was significantly reduced in obese diabetic patients receiving PEX168 compared to the control group (MD\u2009=\u2009-5.46, 95% CI (-7.90, \u2009-\u20093.01), p\u2009<\u20090.0001) but not in non-obese patients (MD\u2009=\u20090.06, 95% CI (-0.47, 0.59), p\u2009=\u20090.83). People who received PEX168 alone or with metformin showed more common gastrointestinal adverse effects, especially nausea and vomiting (p\u2009<\u20090.05). PEX168 100, 200, and 300\u00a0ug monotherapy demonstrated comparable safety and diabetes control to metformin, but when combined with metformin, PEX168 100 and 200\u00a0ug showed significant effects on diabetes control; however, only the latter showed a significantly higher incidence of nausea and vomiting (p\u2009<\u20090.05). PEX168 could be a viable option for treating diabetic patients whose metformin control is inadequate or who cannot tolerate metformin. PEX168 at 100\u00a0ug in combination with metformin was found to be safe and more effective compared to metformin; however, due to the small number of trials included, these findings should be interpreted with caution, and additional trials are required.",

Though insulin resistance (IR) was previously considered a feature of only type 2 Diabetes (T2DM), its development in type 1 Diabetes (T1DM) is not an uncommon occurrence, the causes of which are multifactorial (gender, pubertal status, diabetes duration, ethnicity, genetics, adiposity, glycemic control, chronic inflammation). Despite improvements in glucose, blood pressure and lipid profile, vascular complications (coronary artery disease and nephropathy) continue to remain common causes of morbidity and mortality in T1DM. Aggressive glycemic control reduces but does not eliminate the risk of IR. IR accelerates the development of micro and macrovascular complications, many of which can be potentially reversed if diagnosed and managed early. Lack of endogenous insulin production makes estimation of insulin sensitivity in T1DM difficult. As hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies are cumbersome and invasive, the use of prediction equations for calculating estimated insulin sensitivity may prove to be useful. Along with intensive insulin therapy, dietary modifications and increasing physical activity, the role of Metformin in managing IR in T1DM is becoming increasingly popular. Metformin adjunct therapy in T1DM has been shown to improve insulin sensitivity, glycemic control, lipid profile, body composition, vascular smooth muscle function, thereby reducing the risk of vascular complications, as well as reversal of early vascular dysfunction. However, further studies to assess long-term efficacy and safety of Metformin use in adolescents and youth with T1DM are needed. This review aims at revisiting the pathophysiology of IR in T1DM and techniques of identifying those at risk so as to put into action various strategies for management of the same.",

    "original_text": "The Effectiveness of Metformin in Diabetes Prevention: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.. Diabetes mellitus is a growing global health concern, and prevention strategies play a crucial role in reducing its burden. Metformin has been widely studied as a potential intervention for diabetes prevention, but its overall effectiveness and impact on various populations remain unclear. This study aims to provide a comprehensive synthesis of the available evidence on the effectiveness of metformin in diabetes prevention. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar for articles published from inception to June 2023. The reference lists of the included studies were also searched to retrieve possible additional studies. Any quantitative data were analyzed using Review Manager 5.4. A <i>P</i>-value of 0.05 was adopted as the significance threshold. Our analysis included 17 studies with a total sample size of 30,474. Our meta-analysis included two key analyses. First, the meta-analysis evaluating the effects of metformin on prediabetes demonstrated a significant reduction in the risk of progressing to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The pooled odds ratio (OR) was 0.65 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.53-0.80), indicating a 35% lower odds of developing T2DM among individuals with prediabetes who received metformin interventions compared to control groups. Secondly, the meta-analysis assessing the efficacy of metformin interventions in preventing T2DM yielded a significant reduction in the risk of developing the disease. The pooled risk ratio was 0.58 (95% CI 0.44-0.77), indicating a 42% lower risk of developing T2DM in individuals receiving metformin interventions compared to those in non-metformin intervention groups. These findings provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of metformin in preventing the progression of prediabetes to T2DM and reducing the overall incidence of the disease. The review demonstrated that metformin is effective in reducing the risk of developing diabetes mellitus among individuals at risk for the disease. The findings highlight the potential of metformin as a valuable intervention for diabetes prevention, particularly in high-risk populations.",

It is an ongoing public health crisis, with over 245,373,039 confirmed cases globally, including 4,979,421 deaths as of 29 October 2021. Exploring molecular mechanisms correlated with the disease's severity has demonstrated significant factors of immune compromise, noted in diabetic patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections. Among diabetics, the altered function of the immune system allows for better penetration of the virus into epithelial cells, increased viral binding affinity due to hyperglycemia, reduced T cell function, decreased viral clearance, high risks of cytokine storm, and hyper-inflammatory responses, altogether increasing the susceptibility of these patients to an extreme COVID-19 disease course. <i>Materials and Methods:</i> This research involved a systematic literature search among various databases comprising PubMed and Google Scholar in determining credible studies about the effects of antidiabetic drugs on the high mortality rates among diabetic patients infected with COVID-19. The primary search found 103 results. Duplicated results, non-pertinent articles, and the unavailability of full text were excluded. Finally, we included 74 articles in our review. The inclusion criteria included articles published during 2020-2023, studies that reported a low risk of bias, and articles published in English. Exclusion criteria included studies published in non-peer-reviewed sources, such as conference abstracts, thesis papers, or non-academic publications. <i>Results:</i> Among the studied anti-diabetic drugs, Metformin, the Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), and Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) have demonstrated decreased mortality rates among diabetic patients infected with COVID-19. Insulin and Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i) have demonstrated increased mortality rates, while Sulfonylureas, Thiazolidinedione (TZD), and Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (AGI) have demonstrated mortality-neutral results.",

Patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) usually show progressive deterioration in glycemic control and sequential additions of therapy are generally needed. Many new options for glucose lowering therapy have been introduced recently and it is becoming common practice to use fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) of glucose lowering agents from different classes. This article reviews the FDC of canagliflozin with metformin extended release. A literature search was performed to identify publications describing the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin and metformin when used separately and in combinations. Canagliflozin is a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor which has shown benefits in reducing progression of renal disease and heart failure in patients with T2D. There was an increased incidence of amputation with canagliflozin in one study, but canagliflozin results in weight loss and reduction of blood pressure which contribute to the overall benefit. Metformin has been the first line oral hypoglycemic agent for many years and is thought to have many advantages, but it should be avoided in patients with severely decreased renal function because of the risk of lactic acidosis. The combination in a single tablet given once daily should help to simplify therapy and improve medication adherence in T2D.",

To evaluate the results of using Sildenafil in the form of an oral spray (Gent) for the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED) in men with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and prediabetes. A total of 60 patients were divided into two groups of 30 people. The group 1 included patients with prediabetes, while group 2 consisted of patients with type 2 DM. All men had proven ED. The severity of ED was assessed using the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF-5). To assess the state of penile blood flow, all patients underwent Doppler ultrasound before and after treatment. Patients with prediabetes used Sildenafil in the form of oral spray (Gent) 25 mg (2 doses) 1 time per day for 1 month, patients with type 2 diabetes received 50 mg (4 injections) every other day for 1 month. In addition, most of the subjects took metformin and followed diet therapy. In patients of both groups, the administration of Sildenafil oral spray led to a decrease in body weight, waist circumference, a decrease in insulin and Hemoglobin A1C level without changing of hypoglycemic therapy in those with type 2 DM. In men with prediabetes, a decrease in fasting insulin levels was found. During treatment, half of the persons with impaired glucose metabolism had an increase in the testosterone level. According to IIEF-5, a decrease in the severity of ED in both groups of patients was seen. In men with prediabetes, the average IIEF-5 score increased from 15.98 to 21.57 points (p<0.05), while in patients with type 2 DM it improved from 12.18 to 18.44 points (p<0.05). Doppler ultrasound indicated a significant increase in the maximum systolic blood flow velocity and arterial resistivity index after treatment with Sildenafil oral spray in patients with both prediabetes and type 2 diabetes. Sildenafil oral spray can be effectively used for the treatment of ED in men with type 2 DM and prediabetes.",

To compare the efficiency of two surgical methods, holmium laser enucleation of prostate (HoLEP) and laparoscopic retropubic simple prostatectomy with clamping of internal iliac arteries and vesicourethral anastomosis [LPA+CIIA+VUA]) for treating of patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A total of 56 men with T2DM who underwent surgical treatment of BPH in the National Research Centre for Endocrinology of the Russian Ministry of Health (director - corresponding member of RAS Mokrysheva N.G..) in a period from 2021 until 2022 were included in the study. Patients with T2DM received two types of antidiabetic drugs: basal-bolus insulin therapy and metformin (1000 mg/day per os). Patients were divided into the group of LPA+CIIA+VUA (n=28) and HoLEP (n=28). Preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative examinations with an evaluation of intraoperative and early postoperative complications (I, II, III, IV grades according to the Clavien-Dindo scale) were performed. After 1 year of follow-up, International Prostatic Symptom Score (IPSS), \"Quality of Life\" score (QoL), International Index of Erectile Function-5 score (IIEF-5), maximal urine flow rate (Qmax), and postvoid residual volume (ml) were assessed. Efficiency of surgical procedures was estimated according to \"trifecta\": absence of postoperative complications, urine continence, maximal urine flow (Qmax) >15 ml/sec. In the group of HoLEP, shorter postoperative bladder catheterization time but higher risk of urinary incontinence, bladder neck contracture and urethral strictures was found. LPA+CIIA+UVA leaded to a two-fold decrease in intraoperative hemoglobin loss with no necessity of repeat procedures. Our preliminary results demonstrated higher efficacy of LPA+CIIA+VUA for treatment of BPH in patients with T2DM than HoLEP. Patients who underwent LPA+CIIA+VUA were more often achieved the \"trifecta\". In order to implement LPA+CIIA+VUA into clinical practice, multi-center, large-scale, double-blind, placebo-controlled (\"scar-surgery\") randomized studies are required.",

Obesity is associated with various metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance and adipose tissue inflammation (ATM), characterized by macrophage infiltration into adipose cells. This study presents a new Drosophila model to investigate the mechanisms underlying these obesity-related pathologies. We employed genetic manipulation to reduce ecdysone levels to prolong the larval stage. These animals are hyperphagic and exhibit features resembling obesity in mammals, including increased lipid storage, adipocyte hypertrophy and high circulating glucose levels. Moreover, we observed significant infiltration of immune cells (hemocytes) into the fat bodies, accompanied by insulin resistance. We found that attenuation of Eiger/TNF\u03b1 signaling reduced ATM and improved insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, using metformin and the antioxidants anthocyanins, we ameliorated both phenotypes. Our data highlight evolutionarily conserved mechanisms allowing the development of Drosophila models for discovering therapeutic pathways in adipose tissue immune cell infiltration and insulin resistance. Our model can also provide a platform to perform genetic screens or test the efficacy of therapeutic interventions for diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.",

To identify predictors of body weight (BW) reduction of \u226515% with tirzepatide treatment and to describe associated clinical parameters of participants with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who achieved different categorical measures of BW reduction (<5%, \u22655 to <10%, \u226510 to <15%, and \u226515%)\u00a0across four studies from the phase 3 SURPASS clinical trial program for T2D. The multivariate model for predictor of a BW reduction of \u226515% included age, sex, race, BW, HbA1c, tirzepatide dose and baseline metformin use, fasting serum glucose, and non-HDL cholesterol. Baseline characteristics and change from baseline to week 40/42 for efficacy parameters were described and analyzed in treatment-adherent participants (\u226575% doses administered and on treatment at week 40/42) receiving once weekly tirzepatide (5 mg, 10 mg, or 15 mg) (N = 3,188). Factors significantly associated with achieving a BW reduction of \u226515% with tirzepatide were higher tirzepatide doses, female sex, White or Asian race, younger age, metformin background therapy, and lower HbA1c, fasting serum glucose, and non-HDL cholesterol at baseline. With higher categorical BW reduction, there were greater reductions in HbA1c, triglycerides, ALT, waist circumference, and blood pressure. Baseline factors associated with a higher likelihood of achieving a BW reduction of \u226515% with tirzepatide were higher tirzepatide doses, female sex, White or Asian race, younger age, metformin background therapy, better glycemic status, and lower non-HDL cholesterol. With greater BW reduction, participants with T2D achieved larger improvements in glycemia and cardiometabolic risk parameters. These findings help inform which people with T2D are most likely to achieve greater BW reduction with improved cardiometabolic risk factors with tirzepatide.",

    "original_text": "Dapagliflozin and metformin in combination ameliorates diabetic nephropathy by suppressing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis and activating autophagy in diabetic rats.. Considering the effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter inhibitors and metformin on the kidneys, a combination of both agents is postulated to provide protection against diabetic nephropathy (DN). We examined the potential protective effects of dapagliflozin, metformin, and their combination on kidney injury in rats with type 2 diabetes. Diabetic (DM) rats were administered dapagliflozin (1.0\u00a0mg/kg/day), metformin (100\u00a0mg/kg/day), or a combination (dapagliflozin 0.5\u00a0mg/kg/day plus metformin 50\u00a0mg/kg/day) by oral gavage for 4\u00a0weeks. Dapagliflozin monotherapy or in combination with metformin was more effective than metformin monotherapy in attenuating renal dysfunction, improving renal organic anion transporter 3 expression, and activating renal autophagy by modulating the AMPK/mTOR/SIRT1 axis in DM rats. Interestingly, dapagliflozin monotherapy exhibited greater efficacy in suppressing renal oxidative stress in DM rats than metformin or the combination treatment. Renal and pancreatic injury scores decreased in all treatment groups. Apoptotic markers were predominantly reduced in dapagliflozin monotherapy and combination treatment groups. The low-dose combination treatment, through synergistic coordination, appeared to modulate oxidative, autophagic, and apoptotic signaling and confer significant renoprotective effects against DM-induced complications. In addition, a low dose of the combination might be beneficial to patients by avoiding the risk of side effects of the medication. Future clinical trials are necessary to study the nephroprotective effects of the combined treatment at a low dosage in patients with diabetes.",

Studies reporting the effects of metabolic surgery, lifestyle intervention, and intensive insulin therapy for the remission of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) has been increasing, with fruitful results better conducted and yielded. However, there are only a few studies on the remission of T2DM using oral hypoglycemic drugs. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the remission effect of canagliflozin and metformin on participants with newly diagnosed T2DM and its possible underlying mechanism(s) through which these two medications elicit diabetes remission. To this end, we performed a multicenter, parallel-group, randomized, controlled, and open-label trial. A total of 184 participants with a\u2009\u2264\u20093-year course of T2DM will be enrolled and randomly assigned to the canagliflozin or metformin treatment group in a ratio of 1:1. Participants in each group will maintain their medication for 3 months after achieving the target blood glucose level and then stop it. These participants will be followed up for one year to determine remission rates in both groups. In this study, we will establish that whether canagliflozin is superior to metformin in terms of remission rate in participants with newly diagnosed T2DM. The results of this trial may provide robust evidence regarding the efficacy and mechanisms of the action of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) in T2DM remission.

For decades, metformin has been the drug of first choice in the management of type 2 diabetes. However, approximately 2-13% of patients do not tolerate metformin due to gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. Since metformin influences the gut microbiota, we hypothesized that a multi-strain probiotics supplementation would mitigate the gastrointestinal symptoms associated with metformin usage. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-center, cross-over trial (ProGasMet study) assessed the efficacy of a multi-strain probiotic in 37 patients with metformin intolerance. Patients were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive probiotic (PRO-PLA) or placebo (PLA-PRO) at baseline and, after 12 weeks (period 1), they crossed-over to the other treatment arm (period 2). The primary outcome was the reduction of GI adverse events of metformin. 37 out of 82 eligible patients were enrolled in the final analysis of whom 35 completed the 32 weeks study period and 2 patients resigned at visit 5. Regardless of the treatment arm allocation, while on probiotic supplementation, there was a significant reduction of incidence (for the probiotic period in PRO-PLA/PLA-PRO: P\u00a0=\u00a00.017/P\u00a0=\u00a00.054), quantity and severity of nausea (P\u00a0=\u00a00.016/P\u00a0=\u00a00.024), frequency (P\u00a0=\u00a00.009/P\u00a0=\u00a00.015) and severity (P\u00a0=\u00a00.019/P\u00a0=\u00a00.005) of abdominal bloating/pain as well as significant improvement in self-assessed tolerability of metformin (P\u00a0<\u00a00.01/P\u00a0=\u00a00.005). Moreover, there was significant reduction of incidence of diarrhea while on probiotic supplementation in PRO-PLA treatment arm (P\u00a0=\u00a00.036).

Background Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) arises due to a range of pathological abnormalities, necessitating a combination therapy to achieve optimal glycemic control. Vildagliptin, an effective and selective DPP-4 inhibitor, and pioglitazone, an insulin sensitizer, offer\u00a0distinct mechanisms of action. Hence, the integration of these medications represents a logical and justified therapeutic strategy Objective To compare the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of vildagliptin and pioglitazone 50 mg/15 mg\u00a0fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablets with individual monotherapy vildagliptin 50 mg and pioglitazone 15 mg tablets in Indian T2DM patients who were inadequately controlled on metformin monotherapy. Methods This was a randomized, open-label, comparative, multicenter, phase III study involving 195 T2DM patients with inadequate glycemic control on metformin \u2265 1000 mg/day. Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to the test product group (n=65) (vildagliptin 50 mg + pioglitazone 15 mg FDC tablets), reference product group 1 (n=65) (vildagliptin 50 mg tablet), or reference product group 2 (n=65) (pioglitazone 15 mg tablet reference product). The primary endpoint was the mean change in HbA1c levels from baseline to end of the study visit (12 weeks (84 days \u00b12)). The secondary endpoints were the mean change in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and 2-hr postprandial plasma glucose (2-hr PPG) levels. Safety parameters were assessed till the end of the study. Results A total of 178 patients completed the study. At 12 weeks, the mean HbA1c level in the test group reduced to 6.85 \u00b1 1.27%, in the reference product 1 group to 7.56 \u00b1 1.72%, and in the reference product 2 groups to 7.37 \u00b1 1.59%. The mean change in Hb1Ac from baseline in the test group was statistically significant compared to the reference groups (p=0.037). Similarly, the mean changes in the FPG and 2hr-PPG with the test product were statistically significant compared to reference products (p=0.041). The adverse events were comparable across all the treatment groups. Conclusion In Indian T2DM patients inadequately controlled on a daily maximum dose of metformin, treatment with vildagliptin and pioglitazone FDC showed better glycemic control than either vildagliptin or pioglitazone along with a good tolerability profile.",

    "original_text": "Early use of oral semaglutide in the UK: A cost-effectiveness analysis versus continuing metformin and SGLT-2 inhibitor therapy.. Many people with type 2 diabetes experience clinical inertia, remaining in poor glycaemic control on oral glucose-lowering medications rather than intensifying treatment with a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, despite an efficacious, orally administered option, oral semaglutide, being available. The present study evaluated the long-term cost-effectiveness of initiating oral semaglutide versus continuing metformin plus sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitor therapy in the UK. Outcomes were projected over patients' lifetimes using the IQVIA Core Diabetes Model (V.9.0). Clinical data were taken from the oral semaglutide and placebo arms of the patient subgroup receiving metformin plus an SGLT-2 inhibitor in PIONEER 4. Costs, expressed in 2021 Pounds sterling (GBP), were accounted from a healthcare payer perspective. Modelled patients received oral semaglutide immediately (in the first year of the analysis) or after a 2-year delay, after which all physiological parameters were brought to values observed in the immediate therapy arm. During the simulation, patients intensified with the addition of basal insulin and, subsequently, by switching to basal-bolus insulin. Immediate oral semaglutide therapy was associated with improvements in life expectancy of 0.17 (95% CIs 0.16 to 0.19) years, and quality-adjusted life expectancy of 0.15 (0.14 to 0.16) quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), versus a 2-year delay. Benefits were due to a reduced incidence of diabetes-related complications. Direct costs were estimated to be GBP 1423 (1349 to 1496) higher with immediate oral semaglutide therapy versus a 2-year delay, with higher treatment costs partially offset by cost savings from avoidance of diabetes-related complications. Immediate oral semaglutide therapy was therefore associated with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of GBP 9404 (8380 to 10 538) per QALY gained versus a 2-year delay. Immediate oral semaglutide is likely to represent a cost-effective treatment in people with type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin plus an SGLT-2 inhibitor in the UK.

Left gastric artery embolisation (LGAE) is a well-established treatment for major upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding when control is not established via upper GI endoscopy and recently has shown promising results for weight loss in small single arm studies. LGAE could be a treatment option in between our current tier-3 and tier-4 services for obesity. EMBIO is a National Institute for Health Research funded trial, a multicentre double-blinded randomised controlled trial between Imperial College National Health Service Trust and University College London Hospital, comparing LGAE versus Placebo procedure. The key aims of the trial is to evaluate LGAE efficacy on weight loss, its mechanism of action, safety profile and obesity-related comorbidities. 76 participants will be recruited from the existing tier-3 database after providing informed consent. Key inclusion criteria include adults aged 18-70 with a body mass index 35-50\u2009kg/m<sup>2</sup> and appropriate anatomy of the left gastric artery and coeliac plexus on CT Angiogram. Key exclusion criteria included previous major abdominal and bariatric surgery, weight >150\u2009kg, type 2 diabetes on any medications other than metformin and the use of weight modifying medications. Participants will undergo mechanistic visits 1\u2009week prior to the intervention and 3, 6 and 12\u2009months postintervention. Informed consent will be received from each participant and they will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to left gastric artery embolisation and placebo treatment. Blinding strategies include the use of moderate doses of sedation, visual and auditory isolation. All participants will enter a tier-3 weight management programme postintervention. The primary analysis will estimate the difference between the groups in the mean per cent weight loss at 12\u2009months. This trial shall be conducted in full conformity with the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and all subsequent revisions. Local research ethics approval was granted by London-Central Research Ethics Committee, (Reference 19/LO/0509) on 11 October 2019. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued the Letter of No Objection on 8 April 2022 (Reference CI/2022/0008/GB).

In this paper, we aim to evaluate the efficacy of antidiabetic cardioprotective molecules such as Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter-2 Inhibitors (SGLT-2i) and Glucagon-like Peptide 1 Receptor Agonists (GLP-1 RAs) when used with other glucose-lowering drugs, lipid-lowering, and blood pressure (BP)-lowering drugs in a real-life setting. A retrospective, observational study on 477 patients admitted consecutively in 2019 to the outpatient clinic of a tertiary care unit for Diabetes Mellitus was conducted. Body mass index (BMI), blood pressure (BP) (both systolic and diastolic), and metabolic parameters, as well as A1c hemoglobin, fasting glycaemia and lipid profile, including total cholesterol (C), HDL-C, LDL-C and triglycerides), were evaluated at baseline and two follow-up visits were scheduled (6 months and 12 months) in order to assess the antidiabetic medication efficacy. Both SGLT-2i and GLP-1 RAs were efficient in terms of weight control reflected by BMI; metabolic control suggested by fasting glycaemia and A1c; and the diastolic component of BP control when comparing the data from the 6 and 12-month visits to the baseline, and when comparing the 12-month visit to the 6-month visit. Moreover, when comparing SGLT-2i and GLP-1 RAs with metformin, there are efficacy data for SGLT-2i at baseline in terms of BMI, fasting glycaemia, and HbA1c. In this retrospective study, both classes of cardioprotective molecules, when used in conjunction with other glucose-lowering, antihypertensive, and lipid-lowering medications, appeared to be efficient in a real-life setting for the management of T2DM.",

Its efficacy is due to the suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis, enhancement of peripheral glucose uptake and lower glucose absorption by the intestine. Recent studies have reported Met efficacy in other clinical applications, such as age-related diseases. Despite the wide clinical use of Met, its mechanism of action on muscle and its effect on muscle performance are unclear. We investigated the effects of Met combined with training on physical performance (PP) in healthy rats receiving Met for 8 weeks while undergoing daily moderate exercise. We evaluated the following: PP through graded endurance exercise test performed before the beginning of the training protocol and 48 h before the end of the training period; blood ALT, AST, LDH and CK-MB levels in order to address muscle damage; and several blood and muscle myokines and the expression of factors believed to be involved in muscle adaptation to exercise. Our data demonstrate that Met does not improve the positive effects of exercise on performance, although it protects myocytes from exercise-induced damage. Moreover, given that Met positively affects exercise-induced muscle adaptation, our data support the idea of the therapeutic application of Met when muscle function and structure are compromised.",

Hypoglycemic medications that could be co-administered with prebiotics and functional foods can potentially reduce the burden of metabolic diseases such as Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). The efficacy of drugs such as metformin and sulfonylureas can be enhanced by the activity of the intestinal microbiome elaborated metabolites. Functional foods such as prebiotics (e.g., oligofructose) and dietary fibers can treat a dysbiotic gut microbiome by enhancing the diversity of microbial niches in the gut. These beneficial shifts in intestinal microbiome profiles include an increased abundance of bacteria such as <i>Faecalibacterium prauznitzii</i>, <i>Akkermancia muciniphila</i>, <i>Roseburia species</i>, and <i>Bifidobacterium</i> species. An important net effect is an increase in the levels of luminal SCFAs (e.g., butyrate) that provide energy carbon sources for the intestinal microbiome in cross-feeding activities, with concomitant improvement in intestinal dysbiosis with attenuation of inflammatory sequalae and improved intestinal gut barrier integrity, which alleviates the morbidity of T2DM. Oligosaccharides administered adjunctively with pharmacotherapy to ameliorate T2DM represent current plausible treatment modalities.",

This study investigates the long-term efficacy and safety of evogliptin add-on therapy in patients with inadequately controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) previously received dapagliflozin and metformin (DAPA/MET) combination. In this multicenter randomized placebo-controlled phase 3 trial, patients with glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels 7.0% to 10.5% (n=283) previously used DAPA 10 mg plus MET (\u22651,000 mg) were randomly assigned to the evogliptin 5 mg once daily or placebo group (1:1). The primary endpoint was the difference in the HbA1c level from baseline at week 24, and exploratory endpoints included the efficacy and safety of evogliptin over 52 weeks (trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04170998). Evogliptin add-on to DAPA/MET therapy was superior in HbA1c reduction compared to placebo at weeks 24 and 52 (least square [LS] mean difference, -0.65% and -0.55%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.79 to -0.51 and -0.71 to -0.39; P<0.0001). The proportion of patients achieving HbA1c <7% was higher in the triple combination group at week 52 (32.14% vs. 8.51% in placebo; odds ratio, 5.62; P<0.0001). Evogliptin significantly reduced the fasting glucose levels and mean daily glucose levels with improvement in homeostatic model assessment of \u03b2-cell function (LS mean difference, 9.04; 95% CI, 1.86 to 16.21; P=0.0138). Adverse events were similar between the groups, and no serious adverse drug reactions were reported in the evogliptin group. Long-term triple combination with evogliptin added to DAPA/MET showed superior HbA1c reduction and glycemic control compared to placebo at 52 weeks and was well tolerated.",

To determine the efficacy and safety of once-weekly dulaglutide added to basal insulin in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with inadequate glycaemic control. In the phase III, double-blind AWARD-CHN3 study, Chinese patients with T2DM (N\u2009=\u2009291) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) \u22657.0% and \u226411.0% receiving stable doses of basal insulin glargine with metformin and/or acarbose were randomized (1:1) to receive add-on dulaglutide 1.5\u2009mg once weekly or placebo once weekly. The primary endpoint was the superiority of dulaglutide/glargine to placebo/glargine for change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 28. The least squares (LS) mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009standard error change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 28 was -2.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.08% with dulaglutide/glargine and -1.1\u2009\u00b1\u20090.07% with placebo/glargine (LS mean difference: -1.0%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.1 to -0.8; P\u2009<\u20090.001), and more patients receiving dulaglutide/glargine achieved HbA1c levels <7.0% (75.9% vs. 33.8%; P\u2009<\u20090.001 vs. placebo/glargine).

Reductions in fasting serum glucose were greater with dulaglutide/glargine than with placebo/glargine (LS mean difference: -0.8\u2009mmol/L, 95% CI -1.1 to - 0.5; P\u2009<\u20090.001). The incidence of hypoglycaemia was similar with dulaglutide/glargine and placebo/glargine (29.2% vs. 31.3%; P\u2009=\u20090.704); no patient in either group had severe hypoglycaemia. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events with dulaglutide/glargine were decreased appetite (22.2%), diarrhoea (13.2%) and nausea (10.4%).

    "original_text": "Secondary diabetes mellitus in pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas.. Secondary diabetes mellitus (DM) in secretory pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas (PPGLs) is encountered in up to 50% of cases, with its presentation ranging from mild, insulin resistant forms to profound insulin deficiency states, such as diabetic ketoacidosis and hyperglycemic hyperosmolar state. PPGLs represent hypermetabolic states, in which adrenaline and noradrenaline induce insulin resistance in target tissues characterized by aerobic glycolysis, excessive lipolysis, altered adipokine expression, subclinical inflammation, as well as enhanced gluconeogenesis and glucogenolysis. These effects are mediated both directly, upon adrenergic receptor stimulation, and indirectly, via increased glucagon secretion. Impaired insulin secretion is the principal pathogenetic mechanism of secondary DM in this setting; yet, this is relevant for tumors with adrenergic phenotype, arising from direct inhibitory actions in beta pancreatic cells and incretin effect impairment. In contrast, insulin secretion might be enhanced in tumors with noradrenergic phenotype. This dimorphic effect might correspond to two distinct glycemic phenotypes, with predominant insulin resistance and insulin deficiency respectively. Secondary DM improves substantially post-surgery, with up to 80% remission rate. The fact that surgical treatment of PPGLs restores insulin sensitivity and secretion at greater extent compared to alpha and beta blockade, implies the existence of further, non-adrenergic mechanisms, possibly involving other hormonal co-secretion by these tumors. DM management in PPGLs is scarcely studied. The efficacy and safety of newer anti-diabetic medications, such as glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), as well as potential disease-modifying roles of metformin and SGLT2is warrant further investigation in future studies.",

This trial was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of cetagliptin added to metformin in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control with metformin monotherapy. In total, 446 patients with type 2 diabetes on metformin monotherapy were randomized to receive the addition of once-daily cetagliptin 100\u2009mg, cetagliptin 50\u2009mg and placebo in a 2:2:1 ratio for 24-week double-blind treatment. At week 24, patients initially randomized to cetagliptin 50\u2009mg and placebo were switched to cetagliptin 100\u2009mg for 28\u2009weeks open-label treatment. The primary endpoint was the change in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) from baseline, and the efficacy analyses were based on an all-patients-treated population using an analysis of co-variance. After 24\u2009weeks, both add-on therapies led to greater glycaemic control. Reductions in HbA1c from baseline were -1.17\u2009\u00b1\u20090.794%, -1.23\u2009\u00b1\u20090.896% in cetagliptin 100\u2009mg and 50\u2009mg plus metformin group, respectively. No difference was observed between the cetagliptin 100\u2009mg and 50\u2009mg plus metformin group. Patients with higher baseline HbA1c levels (\u22658.5%) experienced greater reductions in HbA1c. A significantly greater proportion of patients achieved an HbA1c <7.0% with cetagliptin 100\u2009mg (49.4%) and cetagliptin 50\u2009mg (51.1%) plus metformin than metformin monotherapy (14.4%). Both combination therapies also improved the homeostasis model assessment \u03b2-function index and decreased systolic blood pressure. There was no increased risk of adverse effects with combination therapy, and both combination therapies were generally well tolerated. The addition of cetagliptin once daily to metformin was more efficacious and well tolerated than metformin monotherapy in Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes who had inadequate glycaemic control with metformin monotherapy.",

Concerning ascending trend in the prevalence of chronic type II diabetes, prevention and the development of an effective approach after the recognition of at-risk individuals is crucial. This study aims to investigate comparing the influence of lifestyle modification and metformin interventions in the prevention of type II diabetes developments. The search was conducted using PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus and Web of Science databases. The inclusion criteria include randomized controlled trials (RCT) which studied both lifestyle modification and metformin interventions in the population above 18\u00a0years old without a history of any type of diabetes. After excluding studies with intervention time of fewer than 6\u00a0months, a systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to evaluate relative risk (RR) with a confidence interval (CI) of 95% of type II diabetes development. Data from 5 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The population also consists of individuals with a mean age of 50\u00a0years old with BMI and FBS of 35.5 and 104.7\u00a0mg/dl respectively. Participants range of prevention years was between 2-3\u00a0years with a mean of 2.8\u00a0years. Lifestyle modification decreases the probability of the incidence of type II diabetes by 25.3% (RR: 0.747, 95% CI, 0.6-0.92) compared to the metformin intervention (p-value\u2009=\u20090.007). Our results indicate that long-term lifestyle modifications can prevent diabetes type II and decrease diabetes mellitus incidence down to one-quarter in comparison to metformin. Lifestyle modification can be more efficacious than metformin in diminishing the incidence of type II diabetes. Therefore, lifestyle modification can be a therapeutic strategy for controlling type II diabetes incidence, especially in high-risk individuals.",

    "original_text": "Metformin increases the uptake of glucose into the gut from the circulation in high-fat diet-fed male mice, which is enhanced by a reduction in whole-body Slc2a2 expression.. Metformin is the first line therapy recommended for type 2 diabetes. However, the precise mechanism of action remains unclear and up to a quarter of patients show some degree of intolerance to the drug, with a similar number showing poor response to treatment, limiting its effectiveness. A better understanding of the mechanism of action of metformin may improve its clinical use. SLC2A2 (GLUT2) is a transmembrane facilitated glucose transporter, with important roles in the liver, gut and pancreas. Our group previously identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in the human SLC2A2 gene, which were associated with reduced transporter expression and an improved response to metformin treatment. The aims of this study were to model Slc2a2 deficiency and measure the impact on glucose homoeostasis and metformin response in mice. We performed extensive metabolic phenotyping and 2-deoxy-2-[<sup>18</sup>F]fluoro-d-glucose ([<sup>18</sup>F]FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) analysis of gut glucose uptake in high-fat diet-fed (HFD) mice with whole-body reduced Slc2a2 (Slc2a2<sup>+/-</sup>) and intestinal Slc2a2 KO, to assess the impact of metformin treatment. Slc2a2 partial deficiency had no major impact on body weight and insulin sensitivity, however mice with whole-body reduced Slc2a2 expression (Slc2a2<sup>+/-</sup>) developed an age-related decline in glucose homoeostasis (as measured by glucose tolerance test) compared to wild-type (Slc2a2<sup>+/+</sup>) littermates. Glucose uptake into the gut from the circulation was enhanced by metformin exposure in Slc2a2<sup>+/+</sup> animals fed HFD and this action of the drug was significantly higher in Slc2a2<sup>+/-</sup> animals. However, there was no effect of specifically knocking-out Slc2a2 in the mouse intestinal epithelial cells. Overall, this work identifies a differential metformin response, dependent on expression of the SLC2A2 glucose transporter, and also adds to the growing evidence that metformin efficacy includes modifying glucose transport in the gut. We also describe a novel and important role for this transporter in maintaining efficient glucose homoeostasis during ageing.",

Metformin is the first line therapy recommended for type 2 diabetes. However, the precise mechanism of action remains unclear and up to a quarter of patients show some degree of intolerance to the drug, with a similar number showing poor response to treatment, limiting its effectiveness. A better understanding of the mechanism of action of metformin may improve its clinical use. SLC2A2 (GLUT2) is a transmembrane facilitated glucose transporter, with important roles in the liver, gut and pancreas. Our group previously identified single nucleotide polymorphisms in the human SLC2A2 gene, which were associated with reduced transporter expression and an improved response to metformin treatment. The aims of this study were to model Slc2a2 deficiency and measure the impact on glucose homoeostasis and metformin response in mice. We performed extensive metabolic phenotyping and 2-deoxy-2- 18F fluoro-d-glucose ( 18F FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) analysis of gut glucose uptake in high-fat diet-fed (HFD) mice with whole-body reduced Slc2a2 (Slc2a2 -) and intestinal Slc2a2 KO, to assess the impact of metformin treatment.

Early and intensive treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) has been associated with lower risk of diabetes-related complications. Control of overweight and obesity, which are strongly associated with T2D and many of its complications, is also key in the management of the disease. New therapies allow for individualised glycaemic control targets with greater safety. Thus, in patients with a higher cardiovascular and renal risk profile, current guidelines encourage early treatment with metformin together with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors with proven cardiovascular benefit. GLP-1 RAs combine highly efficacious glucose-lowering activity with a reduced risk of hypoglycaemia. Recently, tirzepatide, a first-in-class drug that activates both glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and GLP-1 receptors, has demonstrated very high efficacy in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and weight reduction in clinical trials. Tirzepatide has the potential to help people with T2D reach recommended glycaemic and weight targets (HbA1c\u2009<\u20097% and\u2009>\u20095% weight reduction) and to allow some patients to reach HbA1c measurements close to normal physiological levels and substantial weight reduction. In 2022, tirzepatide was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency for treatment of people with T2D and is currently in development for chronic weight management.",

    "original_text": "Impact on Knowledge, Competence, and Performance of a Faculty-Led Web-Based Educational Activity for Type 2 Diabetes and Obesity: Questionnaire Study Among Health Care Professionals and Analysis of Anonymized Patient Records.. Strategies for managing type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity are evolving with the introduction of targeted therapies, including incretin-based dual agonists and growing knowledge of the importance of multidisciplinary care. Accessible, effective continuing medical education (CME) activities are required to ensure that health care professionals (HCPs) understand and can implement the most recent data to optimize patient outcomes. We aimed to measure changes in knowledge, competence, and self-reported performance and quantitatively evaluate changes in performance using anonymized patient data following participation in a web-based educational activity. The faculty-led CME-accredited activity was based on incretin-based dual agonists and patient education on T2D and obesity. The remaining educational gaps in this field were also identified. A CME-accredited, web-based, multidisciplinary (touchMDT) educational activity titled \"The future for glycemic control and weight loss in T2D and obesity: Incretin-based dual-agonists and optimizing patient education\" was developed. HCP knowledge, competence, and performance were assessed before and after the activity against Moore's expanded outcomes framework (levels 1-5), using self-reported questionnaires and by analyzing anonymized patient record data. For evaluating knowledge and competence (50 respondents before and 50 learners after the activity), the mean number of correctly answered questions was significantly higher post activity (median 5.0, IQR 4.0-6.0 to 6.0, IQR 5.0-7.0; mean 4.98, SD 1.22 to 5.78, SD 1.13; P<.001). Modest, nonsignificant improvements in self-reported performance (N=50 respondents preactivity; N=50 learners postactivity) from before to after the activity were observed (median 4.0, IQR 3.25-4.0 to 4.0, IQR 4.0-4.0; mean 3.64, SD 0.69 to 3.76, SD 0.48; P=.32). PPatient data analysis indicated that patients were being treated more intensively postactivity: before the activity, the most commonly used treatment regimens were metformin monotherapy (13/50, 26%) and dual therapy with metformin plus injectable glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist (RA; 11/50, 22%); post activity, this changed to dual therapy with metformin plus injectable GLP-1 RA (12/50, 24%) and triple therapy with metformin plus injectable GLP-1 RA plus sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i; 10/50, 20%). In addition, there was an increased number of referrals to a combination of specialists (physicians referred 27%, 8/30 of patients to \u22652 specialists before the activity and 36%, 10/28 to \u22652 specialists post activity). The remaining educational gaps included understanding the biology and psychology of obesity, efficacy and safety data for incretin-based dual agonists, and the role of the diabetes educator or diabetes care and education specialist in managing T2D and obesity. This short, web-based CME activity on the management of T2D and obesity led to improvements in HCP knowledge, competence, and performance. Several remaining unmet needs were identified, which can be used to inform the content of future educational activities in this disease area.",

This study aimed to perform a network meta-analysis to objectively evaluate the efficacy and safety of 10 Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) in combination with metformin that is approved for use worldwide in patients with type 2 diabetes and to provide evidence-based support and reference for the selection of clinical treatment. Three databases (PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library) were searched from their respective inception until September 30, 2022. Only randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy and safety of GLP-1RAs for treating type 2 diabetes (T2D) were included. The 10 GLP-1RAs are exenatide (including exenatide twice daily and once weekly), liraglutide, lixisenatide, dulaglutide, PEX168, semaglutide (subcutaneous and oral semaglutide), tirzepatide and albiglutide. 34 RCTs with 10 GLP-1RAs and 12993 patients were included in the Network Meta-Analysis (NMA). According to the NMA, tirzepatide 15 mg, semaglutide 1.0 mg, PEX168-200\u03bcg, oral semaglutide 14 and dulaglutide 1.5 mg reduced HbA1c by -2.23%, -1.57%, -1.12%, -1.10%, -1.09% and body weight by -11.33\u00a0kg, -5.99\u00a0kg, +0.40 kg, -3.95\u00a0kg, -1.87\u00a0kg, respectively. There was no significant difference in the rate of adverse events for tirzepatide 15 mg, oral-semaglutide 14 mg, and semaglutide 1.0 mg. PEX168-200\u03bcg, tirzepatide 15mg, and oral semaglutide 14mg had Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking (SUCRA) values greater than placebo, and only tirzepatide 15mg and oral semaglutide 14mg were significantly different from placebo in the rate of serious adverse events. All GLP-1RA did not lead to increased incidence of hypoglycemia. Albiglutide 30mg and semaglutide 1.0mg significantly differed from placebo in Adverse Event (AE) withdrawal. Finally, the sensitivity analysis and publication bias analysis results indicate that the study results are reliable. This study's results showed that GLP-1RAs were effective in lowering HbA1c and reducing body weight without increased incidence of hypoglycemic reactions. In addition, this study may provide reference and evidence-based medical evidence for clinicians to select GLP-1RAs in patients with T2D and high body mass index (BMI). Based on the NMA results, tirzepatide 15mg and semaglutide 1.0mg may be preferred.",

    "original_text": "The Impact of Metformin on Tumor-Infiltrated Immune Cells: Preclinical and Clinical Studies.. The tumor microenvironment (TME) plays a pivotal role in the fate of cancer cells, and tumor-infiltrating immune cells have emerged as key players in shaping this complex milieu. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the world. The most common standard treatments for cancer are surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapeutic drugs. In the last decade, immunotherapy has had a potential effect on the treatment of cancer patients with poor prognoses. One of the immune therapeutic targeted approaches that shows anticancer efficacy is a type 2 diabetes medication, metformin. Beyond its glycemic control properties, studies have revealed intriguing immunomodulatory properties of metformin. Meanwhile, several studies focus on the impact of metformin on tumor-infiltrating immune cells in various tumor models. In several tumor models, metformin can modulate tumor-infiltrated effector immune cells, CD8<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, and natural killer (NK) cells, as well as suppressor immune cells, T regulatory cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs). In this review, we discuss the role of metformin in modulating tumor-infiltrating immune cells in different preclinical models and clinical trials. Both preclinical and clinical studies suggest that metformin holds promise as adjunctive therapy in cancer treatment by modulating the immune response within the tumor microenvironment. Nonetheless, both the tumor type and the combined therapy have an impact on the specific targets of metformin in the TME. Further investigations are warranted to elucidate the precise mechanisms underlying the immunomodulatory effects of metformin and to optimize its clinical application in cancer patients.",
